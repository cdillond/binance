<h1>DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE</h1>
<p>Binance US recently made changes to their API that likely break some of the functions provided in this package. I haven't had time to review the changes and update this project, so consider it deprecated.</p>

<p>This package aims to simplify the use of Binance's REST API. It has only been tested using binance.us endpoints, and certain features of the binance.com API may be unsupported.</p>
